          <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
          <h5 id="date">April 2017 - September 2017</h5>
          <h5 id="location">Toronto, ON</h5>
          <p>
            I was a part of different "squads" at Universe. Squads were mini-teams of approximately 5 members that tackled different parts of the Universe Platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some awesome things that got shipped are
            <ul>
              <li>Built an open source Ruby gem which implements Apollo Tracing for GraphQL</li>
              <li>Google analytics features that track a lot of revenue for large clients</li>
              <li>A new withdrawals feature within the Admin panel, built using React/Redux</li>
              <li>Lots of cool Ember and React components which adhered to the new design guide</li>
              <li>Internationalization and rebranding of the platform using a custom grid and following a design guide</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            It was very exiting to be involved in a major rebranding and internationalization of the entire company. Colours, typography, icons, and many more things were re-done for a more modern look, and it was amazing to implement some of those things. I was also exposed to a lot of amazing mentorship from fellow developers and senior engineers which helped me grow a lot from a technical aspect.

          <h5 id="location">Waterloo, ON</h5>
          <p>
            I was a part of the core product team at Vidyard.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some cool things I worked on are
            <ul>
              <li>A search bar using Searchkick and Typeahead.js</li>
              <li>Optimizing SQL queries using ActiveRecord for clients that have a very large video collection</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            During my time there, I learned a lot about Ruby on Rails, various Javascript frameworks and their respective best practices. My first exposure to efficient queries using ActiveRecord. Vidyard also implemented a very unique version of agile where I fixed existing bugs, and participated in daily code review with my peers.

          <h4>Software Engineering Intern</h4>
          <h5 id="date">January 2016 - April 2016</h5>
          <h5 id="location">Toronto, ON</h5>
          <p>
            I was part of a small agile team which focused on coming up with creative solutions for business teams.
          </p>

          <p>
            For the majority of my time there, I worked on building a web application from scratch using React, Node, Express, and Socket.io which ended up being demoed to the VP of marketing as well as other business leaders. I also designed and built out a front end careers page for the team I was part of to showcase our skillsets and utility.
          </p>

          <p>
            For a company hackathon, my team and I came up with an idea which won 1st place out of 9 teams and was shown directly to the CIO of American Express. I created UI designs using Sketch 3 and leveraged InvisionApp to put together a demo.
            Many of the engineers there were unfamiliar with a new tool like Sketch, therefore I also mentored and taught the others how to use the tool.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lastly, I learned formal agile methadologies through a dedicated agile coach and participated in a 3 day long agile and SCRUM workshop.

          <h4>iOS Summer Academy Participant</h4>
          <h5 id="date">June 2015 - August 2015</h5>
          <h5 id="location">San Francisco, CA</h5>
          <p>
            I was lucky enough to be accepted as a participant of the Summer Academy at Makeschool.
          <p>

          <p>
            Some sweet things I built are
            <ul>
              <li>An iOS app that grew fairly quickly in popularity after launch</li>
              <li>Integrations with amazing frameworks like Realm</li>
              <li>Custom UI and UX designs using Sketch 3 and InvisionApp</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            My goal was to invision an idea, then design and build out that idea in only 2 months to release to the Apple app store. My idea was Tasky, a delightful to-do app which received 4000+ downloads just 4 months after release.
