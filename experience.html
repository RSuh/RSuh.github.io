            I was a part of different "squads" at Universe. Squads were mini-teams of 5 that tackled different problems on a day to day basis.
            <br /><br />
            I was exposed to a lot of amazing mentorship from fellow developers and senior engineers which helped me grow a lot from a technical aspect.
            <br /><br />
            Also, it was very exiting to be involved in a major rebranding of the entire company. Colours, typography, icons, and many more things were re-done for a more modern look, and it was amazing to implement some of those things.

            I was a part of the core product team at Vidyard.
            <br />
            <br />
            During my time there, I learned a lot about Ruby on Rails, various Javascript frameworks and their respective best practices. My first exposure to efficient queries using ActiveRecord.
            <br />
            <br />
            Vidyard implemented a very unique version of agile where I fixed existing bugs, and participated in daily code review with my peers.

          <h4>Software Engineering Intern</h4>
          <h5 id="date">January 2016 - April 2016</h5>
          <h5 id="location">Toronto, ON</h5>
          <p>
            I was part of a small agile team which focused on coming up with creative solutions for business teams.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the majority of my time there, I worked on building a web application from scratch using React, Node, Express, and Socket.io which ended up being demoed to the VP of marketing as well as other business leaders. I also designed and built out a front end careers page for the team I was part of to showcase our skillsets and utility.
            <br />
            <br />
            For a company hackathon, my team and I came up with an idea which won 1st place out of 9 teams and was shown directly to the CIO of American Express. I created UI designs using Sketch 3 and leveraged InvisionApp to put together a demo.
            Many of the engineers there were unfamiliar with a new tool like Sketch, therefore I also mentored and taught the others how to use the tool.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lastly, I learned formal agile methadologies through a dedicated agile coach and participated in a 3 day long agile and SCRUM workshop.

          <p>
            I was lucky enough to be a participant of the Summer Academy at Makeschool.
            <br /><br />
            The goal was to invision an idea, and then design and build out that idea in only 2 months to release to the Apple app store.
            <br /><br />
            My idea that came to fruition was Tasky, a delightful to-do app which received 4000+ downloads just 4 months after release.
